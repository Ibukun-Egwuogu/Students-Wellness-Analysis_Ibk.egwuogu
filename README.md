# Students-Wellness-Analysis_Ibk.egwuogu
A wellness analysis for students, with a dashboard visualizing health risk levels, sleep quality, study hours, and physical activity, providing actionable insights to enhance student well-being and optimize academic and lifestyle strategies.

**OBSERVATIONS FROM STUDENTS’ WELLNESS ANALYSIS**

**1. Heart Rate by Age of Students**
•    Observation: The average heart rate increases with age, peaking at 71.5 bpm for 22-year-olds, and then declines to 69.5 bpm at 24 years.
•    Implications:
o    Students in their early 20s may be experiencing higher stress or physical activity levels, contributing to the peak heart rate.
o    Targeted stress-reduction or fitness programs might help normalize heart rates.

**2. Health Risk Levels per Student**
•    Observation: Most students (672) fall under the Moderate Risk category, while 190 students are at Low Risk and 135 at High Risk.
•    Implications:
o    Many students may need improved health management strategies to reduce moderate risks.
o    Students in the high-risk category require immediate attention, including access to medical and counseling resources.

**3. Effect of Mood on Study Hours**
•    Observation: Students in a neutral mood studied the most, clocking 12.6k hours, while those who were happy studied slightly less (12.1k hours). Stressed students studied the least (5.5k hours).
•    Implications:
o    Stress significantly reduces study productivity. Wellness programs focused on stress management could enhance academic outcomes.
o    Encouraging positive emotions or mental states may further increase study hours and efficiency.

**4. Classification of Students by Gender**
•    Observation: The student population is almost evenly split, with 519 female (51.9%) and 481 male (48.1%) students.
•    Implications:
o    Gender-based analysis of wellness programs can provide balanced support.
o    Campaigns and initiatives should aim for inclusivity to address the needs of both genders.

**5. Effect of Physical Activity on Heart Rate**
•    Observation: Students with moderate physical activity had the highest heart rate (34.62K bpm total), followed by those with low activity (21.18K bpm) and high activity (14.30K bpm).
•    Implications:
o    Moderate physical activity may correspond to a healthy and sustainable level of exercise, but high activity might reduce heart rate.
o    Tailoring exercise regimens based on heart rate data can help maintain cardiovascular health.

**6. Effect of Project Hours on Sleep Quality**
•    Observation: Students with 7.1k project hours reported good sleep quality, while those with 4.5k hours reported moderate sleep quality and 3.0k hours experienced poor sleep quality.
•    Implications:
o    Increased project work seems positively correlated with good sleep quality, suggesting structured schedules might benefit sleep patterns.
o    Poor sleepers might require time-management training to balance academic and personal life effectively.

**7. Classification of Students by Age**
•    Observation: The highest student ID registrations are seen at ages 18 (160 students) and 21 (156 students), with the lowest at age 24 (136 students).
•    Implications:
o    Programs targeted at incoming younger students could address adjustment issues and academic preparation.
o    Support services might need to shift focus as students age to address declining enrollment or engagement.

**8. Average Weekly Study Hours**
•    Observation: Students average 30.23 study hours per week.
•    Implications:
o    Study patterns are within expected ranges, but improving time management or reducing distractions could enhance learning outcomes further.
o    Additional support for students spending less than the average study hours could close performance gaps.

**9. Average Heart Rate**
•    Observation: The average heart rate across all students is 70.10 bpm.
•    Implications:
o    This indicates a relatively healthy population. Regular heart rate monitoring should continue to identify early health risks.
o    Encouraging physical activity and stress management can help maintain a stable average.


**RECOMMENDATIONS**

**1. Heart Rate by Age of Students**
•    Recommendation: Implement regular fitness assessments to monitor heart rate trends by age. Provide tailored physical activity programs for older students to maintain cardiovascular health.
•    Intervention: Offer stress-relief workshops or fitness programs, such as yoga and mindfulness sessions, particularly targeting students aged 22-24 who show higher heart rate variability.

**2. Health Risk Levels per Student**
•    Recommendation: Develop a tiered health management plan:
o    Moderate Risk: Implement preventive measures like routine health check-ups and wellness workshops.
o    High Risk: Provide one-on-one counseling, detailed health assessments, and immediate medical intervention.
•    Intervention: Collaborate with healthcare providers to offer on-campus medical screenings and promote healthy lifestyle choices like balanced diets and exercise.

**3. Effect of Mood on Study Hours**
•    Recommendation: Create a positive study environment to reduce stress and improve academic productivity.
•    Intervention:
o    Introduce mentorship programs and peer-support groups to address stress-related challenges.
o    Host recreational activities like art therapy, music events, or mindfulness exercises to enhance mood.

**4. Classification of Students by Gender**
•    Recommendation: Promote inclusivity in wellness programs by designing initiatives that address the unique needs of both genders.
•    Intervention: Conduct gender-specific focus groups to understand health challenges and tailor resources (e.g., gender-sensitive counseling services, targeted health campaigns).

**5. Effect of Physical Activity on Heart Rate**
•    Recommendation: Promote moderate physical activity as the ideal level for maintaining healthy heart rates.
•    Intervention:
o    Encourage participation in intramural sports or group fitness classes.
o    Provide resources such as fitness trackers and educational materials on maintaining healthy exercise levels.

**6. Effect of Project Hours on Sleep Quality**
•    Recommendation: Teach time management and prioritization techniques to students who experience poor sleep due to inadequate project planning.
•    Intervention:
o    Host workshops on efficient project planning and stress management.
o    Offer counseling for students with chronic sleep issues and provide resources like meditation apps or sleep hygiene guides.

**7. Classification of Students by Age**
•    Recommendation: Introduce age-specific programs to meet the unique needs of different age groups, particularly younger students who may require adjustment support.
•    Intervention:
o    For younger students (18-21): Offer orientation programs, academic tutoring, and social support networks.
o    For older students (22-24): Focus on career readiness programs and stress management as they approach graduation.

**8. Average Weekly Study Hours**
•    Recommendation: Identify students falling below the average study time of 30.23 hours and provide targeted academic support to enhance study habits.
•    Intervention:
o    Introduce study skill workshops and personalized academic coaching.
o    Develop study spaces with minimal distractions to improve focus and time utilization.

**9. Average Heart Rate**
•    Recommendation: Maintain and monitor the current average heart rate of 70.10 bpm through routine health screenings and physical activity programs.
•    Intervention:
o    Implement campus-wide wellness initiatives like step challenges or physical fitness campaigns.
o    Provide nutrition counseling to ensure students are consuming heart-healthy foods.
